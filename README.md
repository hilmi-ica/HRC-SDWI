# Resilient Control on Subsea Seawater Injection System

This repository contains simulations for faulted cascade pump system using the multi-stage NMPC algorithm, supporting our submission to the IFAC World Congress.

## Purpose

Sharing MATLAB code and data for reproducing results and facilitating review.

## Repository Structure

* **`??`**: ??Python simulation code for optimization of proof test regime.
* **`??`**: ??Library of functions to accompany `TestRegime.py` and `CompPFD.py`.
* **`??`**: ??MATLAB simulation code for DAC of the feed pump using multi-stage NMPC.

## Requirement

* [Matlab Optimization Toolbox](https://se.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html)
* [YALMIP: A Toolbox for Modeling and Optimization in MATLAB](https://yalmip.github.io)

## IFAC World Congress

This repository directly supports data and code for our paper submission.
